##Pavel Nikolov (MajorDP)

I'm a 22 year-old, third-year Computer Science student at "St. Cyril and St. Methodius" University of Veliko Tarnovo trying to better himself one step at a time. My expertise spans JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, and a variety of other cutting-edge technologies. 

Here, you'll find my projects that showcase my skills in creating dynamic, user-friendly applications and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm. Whether it's a sleek front-end design or a robust full-stack solution, I strive to blend my creativity with technical prowess.
